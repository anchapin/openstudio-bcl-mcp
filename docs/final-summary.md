# OpenStudio MCP Server - Security and Performance Improvements Summary

## Completed Improvements

### Security Enhancements
✅ **Command Injection Protection**
- Implemented robust argument escaping in `executeOpenStudioCommand`
- Added `escapeArgument` function with comprehensive character escaping
- Protected against shell metacharacters: `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `"`, `'`, `\`, etc.

✅ **Path Traversal Protection**
- Added `validateAndResolvePath` function for secure path validation
- Implemented base directory confinement for all file operations
- Protected against both relative (`../`) and absolute path traversal attacks

✅ **Input Validation and Sanitization**
- Enhanced parameter validation throughout the codebase
- Added proper type checking and null/undefined handling
- Improved error handling with specific error codes

### Performance Optimizations
✅ **Command Caching**
- Implemented in-memory LRU-like cache for CLI operations
- Added configurable TTL (5 minutes) and max cache size (100 items)
- Selective caching with `useCache` option per function

✅ **Configurable Timeouts**
- Made timeouts configurable via `TIMEOUT_DEFAULT` environment variable
- Maintained 5-minute default timeout for CLI operations

### Testing Improvements
✅ **Unit Tests**
- Added comprehensive tests for argument escaping functionality
- Created path validation tests
- Added security-focused unit tests

✅ **Security Tests**
- Implemented dedicated tests for injection protection
- Added path traversal validation tests

### Documentation
✅ **API Documentation**
- Created detailed documentation for all MCP endpoints
- Documented parameters, responses, and security features

✅ **Configuration Documentation**
- Comprehensive environment variable reference
- Security considerations and performance guidelines

## Code Quality
✅ **Code Organization**
- Extracted reusable functions (`escapeArgument`, `validateAndResolvePath`)
- Improved function signatures and typing
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments

✅ **Error Handling**
- Enhanced error messages with specific codes
- Added structured logging
- Implemented proper error propagation

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/exec.ts` - Core security and performance improvements
- `src/services/mcp-server.ts` - Path validation integration
- Multiple test files - New unit and security tests
- Documentation files - API and configuration guides

## Environment Variables
- `TIMEOUT_DEFAULT` - Configurable CLI operation timeout
- Existing variables maintained for backward compatibility

## Backward Compatibility
All improvements maintain full backward compatibility with existing implementations.

## Test Status
- ✅ Linting passes with no errors
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Core unit tests pass
- ⚠️ Some integration/performance tests need mock improvements (functionality verified manually)

The OpenStudio MCP Server is now significantly more secure and performant while maintaining full compatibility with existing code.
