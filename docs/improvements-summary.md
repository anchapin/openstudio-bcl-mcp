# OpenStudio MCP Server - Security and Performance Improvements

This document summarizes the security and performance improvements made to the OpenStudio MCP Server.

## Security Improvements

### 1. Command Injection Protection

Implemented proper argument escaping in the `executeOpenStudioCommand` function to prevent command injection attacks:

- Added `escapeArgument` function that escapes special characters in command line arguments
- Special characters like `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `"`, `'`, `\` are properly escaped
- All arguments are quoted when they contain special characters
- Added comprehensive unit tests to verify the escaping functionality

### 2. Path Traversal Protection

Added path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks:

- Implemented `validateAndResolvePath` function that ensures all file paths are within configured base directories
- Applied path validation to all file operations in the CLI execution utilities
- Added unit tests to verify path validation functionality
- Protected against both relative path traversal (`../`) and absolute path traversal (`/etc/passwd`)

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

Enhanced input validation throughout the codebase:

- Added proper type checking and validation for all function parameters
- Implemented null/undefined value handling
- Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate error types and messages

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Command Caching

Implemented an in-memory caching mechanism for CLI command results:

- Added simple LRU-like cache with configurable TTL (5 minutes by default)
- Configurable maximum cache size (100 items by default)
- Selective caching - cache only appropriate operations (e.g., validation results)
- Automatic cache cleanup of expired entries
- Configurable per-command basis with `useCache` option

### 2. Configurable Timeouts

Made command timeouts configurable through environment variables:

- Added `TIMEOUT_DEFAULT` environment variable for configurable default timeout
- Default timeout set to 5 minutes (300,000 ms)
- Per-command timeout configuration through function parameters

## Testing Improvements

### 1. Unit Tests

Added comprehensive unit tests for security and performance features:

- Command argument escaping tests
- Path validation tests
- Cache functionality tests (simplified)

### 2. Security Tests

Added dedicated security tests to verify protection mechanisms:

- Argument escaping verification
- Path traversal protection tests
- Command injection protection tests

## Documentation Improvements

### 1. API Documentation

Created comprehensive API documentation:

- Detailed tool descriptions with parameters and responses
- Security features overview
- Error handling information

### 2. Configuration Documentation

Created detailed configuration documentation:

- Environment variable reference
- Directory structure guide
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization guidelines

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Code Organization

- Extracted argument escaping logic into reusable `escapeArgument` function
- Improved function signatures with proper typing
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments

### 2. Error Handling

- Enhanced error messages with specific error codes
- Added structured logging for debugging
- Implemented proper error propagation

## Environment Variables

### New Environment Variables

- `TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`: Configurable default timeout for CLI operations (default: 300000 ms)
- Existing variables maintained for backward compatibility

## Backward Compatibility

All improvements maintain full backward compatibility with existing code and configurations.
